This repo is for automating the build of WinRT/UWP libraries for [FNA](https://fna-xna.github.io/).

There is currently just one workflow:

1.  **UWP Build (FNA3D)**.  This is for the beta version of FNA3D.  See [here](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/wiki/BETA:-FNA3D) for details.  For WinRT this uses Directx11 by default as the renderer.  This does *not* require ANGLE.
